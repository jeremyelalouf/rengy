# The Rengy â€” A Rusty Engine

Essentially, it will consist of an ECS implementing various necessary systems, with a particular emphasis on a GPU-accelerated rendering system.

The goal of this project is to explore various aspects of game architecture and hardware-accelerated rendering.

Through this project, I aim to enhance my skills in:
- Rust programming
- GPU interaction and utilization
- Game engine architecture (potentially utilizing an ECS ðŸ¥³)

Additionally, I plan to delve into:
- Concurrent programming in Rust
- Managing a long-term personal project intended to become open source eventually

## Technologies to be utilized
The core of this project revolves around the use of modern and challenging technologies, including:

- Rust as the primary programming language
- Use of [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) for graphics
- Use of [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) for windowing
